# IoT_for_water_management

In this repository there is a subset of the data used in the paper 

[**IoT for Water Management: Towards Intelligent Anomaly Detection**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8767190)

and also, part of the analysis related to anomaly detection. The content is as follows:

- *aggregatedMeters*: 9 of the water meters data
- *faults.csv*: manually anotated faults that were detected by a professional in each of the meters
- *02.outliers-ii.R*: script to apply ARIMA and HOT-SAX for finding oultiers in the previous series
- *plots*: folder where the plots from the previous script are stored
